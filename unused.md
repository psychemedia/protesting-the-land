VICE-CHANCELLOR'S COURT, Nov. 4.

PRACTICE OF THE COURT WITH RESPECT TO INJUNCTIONS.

COURT `sic` AND CO. V. MOUNTJOY AND CO.

Mr. HART moved for an injunction against the defendants under the following circumstances:—His Majesty is seized, in right of the Crown, of the Forest of Dean, in Gloucestershire, which contains much iron and coal. Any person who may be desirous of working a mine in the forest must make application to the King's Steward of the Forest, who, if he think fit, will grant the person so applying a tract of land for that purpose.— In 1800 the plaintiffs obtained the grant of a piece of ground, and the defendants also were put into possession of some contiguous land. The respective boundaries of each tract of land were accurately defined. The plaintiffs lately had reason to suspect that the defendants were encroaching upon their boundaries; and on the 20th of August they had the ground dialled, when it appeared that the defendants had entered the boundaries of the plaintiff's, and were about to sink a pit there in order to discharge the water out of their own mine into that of their neighbours', the effect of which would be the complete destruction of the works. The injunction he applied for was to restrain the defendants from proceeding with the construction of the pit.

The VICE-CHANCELLOR observed, that the Court was always unwilling to issue an injunction on an *ex-parte* application, unless the absolute necessity of the proceeding were evident. In the present case there certainly was *prima facie* evidence of necessity, but at the same time, if the Learned Counsel had reason to believe that no irreparable mischief would ensue from the delay necessary in order to give the defendants notice, the Court would not grant the injuction, but let the case stand over. The Lord Chancellor had lately established a custom which was unknown to his predecessors—namely, that of directing an injunction to stand over until the defendant received notice of the motion. This practice he (the Vice-Chancellor) was desirous of following, because he knew that frequently the desire to prevent irreparable mischief being done to a plaintiff caused irreparable mischief to be inflicted upon a defendant.— The Court, therefore, in future, would expect, that on an application for an injuncton, it should appear upon affidavit either that there had not been time, or that it would have been dangerous to give the defendant notice, otherwise the motion would be refused.

Mr. HART said he was informed by his clients that the most unfortunate results would ensue to them if the injunction did not immediately issue.

The VICE-CHANCELLOR said, that under these circumstances, and because the rule laid down by the Lord Chancellor was not generally known, he would grant the injunction in the present instance.

VICE CHANCELLOR'S COURT, FRIDAY

COUNT `sic` AND CO. V. MOUNTJOY AND OTHERS.

This was a motion by Mr. BELL, on the part of the defendants to dissolve an injunction granted by his Honour in June last, by which the said defendants were restrained from working a coal mine. Mr. Wetherell was with Mr. Bell. The arguments in favour of the motion were, that the title of the plaintiffs being precisely that of the defendants, it was for them to show cause why the latter should not have the same liberty. The facts of the case were these:—Both parties had rented grounds in the Forest of Dean, in Gloucestershire, for the purpose of establishing and working collieries. The manner in which land is let in that forest is this. The King's *Gavellers* measure out to each tenant a space of ground of a circular form, 24 feet in diameter, called a *gale*, in which they may sink a shaft and work the coal-mines below, according to the custom of the forest.

Mr. HART and Mr. PHILMORE on behalf of the plaintiffs, urged the continuance of the injunction, on the grounds that to dissolve it would be to do an irreparable injury, while its continuauce could only cause one for which compensation might be made. If the defendants were to continue the mine where they had already sunk a deep hole, the consequence would be that when they arrived at the boundaries of the adjacent mine, a sudden inundation must overwhelm_the plaintiff's workmen.

His HONOUR said not knowing the custom of the forest, he should only dissolve so much of the injunction as restrained generally. A Jury should be summoned to determine the custom of the forest, and surveyors appointed to *dial* according to their verdict. The Jurors should be miners well acquainted with the customs of the place. He would be thus prepared to consider defendant's motion on the last day of Term.
