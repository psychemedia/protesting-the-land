"The Charnwood Opera" is a drama performed (and apparently composed) in a forest community in central England in the mid-eighteenth century. In 1748 one of the local landowners, William Herrick, and others made an attempt to divide up a large tract of land in Leicestershire known as Charnwood Forest and stock it with rabbit warrens for their personal use. Rioting broke out and was suppressed with loss of life. The play is a dramatization of this vigorous resistance, which was put up to contest the way local landowners were appropriating for their private income and amusement land which had been customarily held in common. Although the uprising failed, the forest was not enclosed until the beginning of the nineteenth century, more than fifty years after the uprising described in the opera.

Texts on such radical and provocative themes were rarely accepted for printing at that time, and "The Charnwood Opera" was never published or, as far as we know, performed outside the Charnwood district.  It survives, together with a satirical song on the same events, "The Coney Warren",[1] in a single manuscript in an eighteenth century hand. The writer Roy Palmer published part of ‘The Coney Warren’ in 1979 but this and the opera still remain unpublished as a whole.[2]

The manuscript was found by the English historian W. E. Tate in a bundle of old books and given to the Museum of English Rural Life in Reading. It is the only contemporary evidence in song of the whole rural struggle against enclosure in England.

The Plot

The drama opens on a winter’s morning at The Hollybush tavern on the edge of the forest, where Tom Piper is calling together the ‘commoners’, that is, people whose livelihood depends on access to the common land to graze their cattle, gather and cultivate edible plants or catch game.  Frank Farmer arrives and denounces those who are setting up rabbit warrens on the commons to stock their own larder, saying that this is a return to the time of Popery and the Bloody Assizes.  All join in with a cry of "Rabbits and Popery".  Then a figure called Spectator steps forward and delivers a speech full of classical references, a contrast to the plain speech of the commoners themselves, who call themselves the "brave boys of Charley".

In the second scene, Spectator describes how the supporters of the warreners close in with their dogs.  The commoners are supported by a group of colliers coming from the small coalfield adjoining the Forest.  The gentry then arrive, and they too attempt to pacify the commoners with a speech and a bribe.  It is rejected with contempt. The gentry then turn to a compliant lawyer to make a case on the basis of the property laws.  As a result, thirty of the protestors are surrounded by hired thugs and arrested, leading to the death of one of the commoners.  The drama ends with them grimly facing the prospect of further struggles to come.

The Characters

The names of the protesters, Joseph Shepherd, Frank Farmer, George Gutler, Jo Taylor and Daniel Digwell, suggest solid and virtuous villagers, who are of course the people likely to have rights to common land.  Tailors were associated with the spread of popular politics or subversive ideas since they had to travel in order to pursue their livelihood, but here Jo Taylor, wearing the apron of his trade, is mostly interested in the skin of the coney, which will be a source of profit.  Having rights to the common generally depended on possessing at least a cottage, another property qualification but one with implications of independence, not exclusiveness and domination.  Other names suggest that the performance of the text would have included a band, or otherwise seem to define a festive occasion: there is Tom Piper, Frank Fiddler, and of course Tom Tippler, who is eager to use the money gained on celebratory drinking, which in turn will make the party sing better: "our tongues, boys, at night shall be quicker".  This argues for a close connection between the play and "The Coney Warren,"  although there are differences of emphasis: for example, where the song names the guilty and the scene of their crime, the opera ranges more widely, with calls for resistance to all attempts to "change Right for Rhetoric".

[1] The manuscript uses both the forms "Use of a Coney Warren" and "A Coney Warren. Its Use".  It Is referred to here as simply "The Coney Warren".

This is one of two songs taken from The Charnwood Opera, a play organised by a local rural community in protest at enclosure. Employing a ubiquitous, infectious tune, the song launches an explicit, excoriating attack on both specific targets and enclosers, excisemen, and politicians in general – but it also weaves in sexual innuendo via the homophone coney/cunny. It is a rare, exhilarating example of bottom-up invective.

I’le tell ye a Tale that is merry and new –
You’ll like it the better, Because it is true –
Of a Comical Country-Squire Become
A Keeper of Coneys for pleasure at Home.
Derry down, &c.

A strange greedy Creature, with horrible Maw,
For She will Eat nothing but Flesh that is raw,
And Gobbles it up without reason or Sense,
Which put the poor Squire to grievous expense,
Derry down, &c.

But being long-headed, He trumped up a Claim
To Land on the Common that’s Royal by name,
Where he nurs’d up a Warren, by little and little,
Till the Wild Coneys found the Tame Coney Vittle,
Derry down, &c.

So the Squire savd his Money. The wife out of Order,
Sick or Sullen, this Tan [dame?] took her place in a corner.
But Oh Hone and Alas! The sweet Doings are done;
For the Warren’s Destroyed and the Coneys are gone.
Derry down, &c.

[Squire speaks:]
"A pox on the Poachers! the Diggers! the Devil!
The Justices slow, and the Neighbourhood Evil.
Our Pockets must pay, but our Pleasures are flown.
What shall Gentlemen do, now the Coneys are gone?"
Derry down, &c.

The Land upon B[rand] hill, ’tis very well known,
Where he planted his Warren, was none of his own.
He craftily stockd it with very small Labour
With Coneys the Poachers had stole from his Neighbour.
Derry down, &c.

Good Lord, what a Difference! I sigh when I’me told
Of our modern Squires, and the Gentry of Old.
Generosity then distinguish’d the Man;
But find Common Honesty now, If you can.
Derry down, &c.

The Turf is short-bitten by Rabbets, And now
No Milk can be stroak’d from the Old Woman’s Cow.
Tom Thresher’s poor Children look sadly, And say
They must eat Water-porridge three times in a Day,
Derry down, &c.

If our greedy old Squire can Escape without Blame,
Other Lords, Knights and Squires will soon do the Same.
All the Commons in England shall Warrens become.
The Coneys on Commons keep Coney at Home.
Derry down, &c.

This ís not the worst. Great Example’s a Mover,
And Each sorry Swain is a Criminal Lover.
Who will wed a poor Wife, that can have his Desire
Of a Wench that is Servant, and do as the Squire?
Derry down, &c.

Did I slip out the word "Example great"?
’Twas wrong! Both Squire and Boor will imitate.
Better have drawn the skreen. And yet, my friend,
Great Beelzebub’s a foul and ugly Fiend.
Derry down, &c.

Have Sawny and Jockey no claim on the common?
They’ll thieve, and they’ll cheat, swear and lie for a Woman.
The Parson may Pray, and may Preach with a Pox,
And bid you be penitent, and Orthodox:
The Squire’s Example does scab all the flocks.
Derry down, &c.

The Gentleman-Wasp Virgin-honey must taste,
The Bees shall take up with his Leavings at last.
What comes of the Spawn of this scandalous Crew?
Excisemen, and Footmen, and Parsons Enow.
Derry down, &c.

For what pay we Taxes? Is Government gone
Shall fourty good Bees labour hard for a Drone?
Then Rouse up, bold Brittons! Be valiant Men!
And burn nasty Wasps, As they stink in their Den.
Derry down, &c.

To live with an Whore, as a Lord or a Knight,
And flare, and look big, in the Country’s sight,
Blood-suckers o’ th’ Poor, Whilst themselves they do feed,
Which is worse than Rebellion, or Witchcraft indeed.
Derry down, &c.

By Cunning they live, which they call Politicks,
By Fraud, Circumvention, and fourty sharp Tricks.
What a Cobler would scorn, becomes the Sharp Squire,
As the Gallows, a Knight of the Post, for his Hire.
Derry down, &c.

What Man would not tremble, to think of a Maid,
An Innocent, Helpless, Debauch’d and betray’d,
Undone by her Master, the Rogue of a Squire,
Sure, Sodom deserv’d a less punishing fire.
Derry down, &c.

These Monsters of Nature, Our Squires of the Day,
Will taste of all pleasure, For none will they pay.
Griping Avarice, join’d to Debauchery, make
Them Devils incarnate, most fit for the Lake.
Derry down, &c.

If Murther in Embryo, and Rape, are a Jest,
The Land is defil’d, and the Man is a Beast.
Shall he leave an Heir? Let him jest at the Tree!
The Victim of Vice an Atonement will be.
Derry down, &c.

So, God Bless King George! And defend us from Evil
And send all Encroachers on Commons to th’Devil.
Let him flea the sharp Squire, who worrys the Poor,
Like ours, to wax wealthy, and live with an Whore,
Derry down, &c.

If Gentlemen venture Damnation at last,
Let all honest Fellows be modest and Chast.
Let us kiss our Wives, and let Wenches alone,
And every man be content with his own.
Derry down, &c.

This is the second of two songs taken from The Charnwood Opera, a play organised by a local rural community in protest at enclosure. This four-verse protest makes expert use of its tune ‘The Vicar of Bray’ to evoke the twisting tricks over time of enclosers, and it combines a familiar nostalgia for better days with bellicose defiance, threatening violence against the despotic local landowners it ridicules as ‘little Squires’.

When Popish Jemmy Ruled the Land
Tune:	The Vicar of Bray
Lyrics:	Unknown
When Popish Jemmy rul’d this Land,
He rul’d it like a King, Sir.
And bloody Jeffereys went about
Hanging and Jibbeting, Sir.
The Warreners prickd up their Ears;
That was a Time of Grace, Sir.
Game-Laws and Justices were made,
And Rabbets bred apace, Sir!

They cover’d all our Common Ground
Or soon would do, no doubt, Sir:
But now, whilst George the Second reigns,
We’l pull the Vermin out, Sir.
If little Squires should spoil our Sport,
We’l make the Marplots fly, Sir,
The Warrener and all his Gang,
Rabbets and Popery, Sir!

"written as a protest against a local landowner, William Herrick, who attempted to enclose areas of common land in Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire and develop rabbit warrens for private use."


http://www.herrickfamilyassociation.org/newsletter/March%202018.pdf

Written in 1753 by an unknown author, it relates events surrounding a dispute
between landowner William Herrick and the local commoners.

… It is one of a very few surviving examples of a protest ballad against enclosure.
Herrick had been steadily encroaching upon common lands, enclosing areas and stocking them with rabbits for his personal use. He employed armed warreners to deter locals from breaking into his new enclosures.

To oppose what they saw as the ongoing theft of common land, a group of local commoners, aided by colliers from Coleorton, armed themselves with pitch-forks, spades and pickaxes. They met at Charley Knoll, just west of Woodhouse, and confronted the warreners. A fight broke out as the warreners tried to stop the fences being pulled down and the warrens destroyed. In the confusion, a commoner named William Stevenson received a severe head wound. He died shortly after.

The ballad was performed at a Forest pub known as the Holly Bush a few years after the riot. Its seven songs introduce various characters who voice the commoners, warreners, lawyers, bailiffs and informers.

One song, ‘The Coney Warren’, is addressed to William Herrick and a Swithland landowner, Danvers. It describes the mood of many locals who felt impoverished by the manorial lords’ selfish grasping of common resources.
