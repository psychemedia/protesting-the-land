# The Diggers

I havenlt been able to find a simple narrative describing the movements of the diggers that dates from the 19th century.

One possible inspiration might actually be Hugh Lupton's telling... but is that cheating?

But there was another set of men, Account more precisely entitled to the appellation, that is scarcely indeed worthy to be recorded, except so far as their proceedings may tend to illustrate the character and temper of the age. These men called themselves the Diggers. The names of two of their leaders have come down to us, Gerrard Winstanley, and Everard, the former a writer of numerous tracts in support of their tenets. Their principles were, that God gave all things in common, and that every man has a right to the fruits of the earth. They professed an intention to molest no one in his possessions; but they asserted that the time was come when the whole world would shortly espouse their principles. They made their appearance at St. George's Hill, near Walton in Surrey, Winstanley and Everard being at their head, with about thirty followers; and, resorting to an open common, they began to dig the earth, and deposit in it seeds and roots. They were not however permitted to proceed without molestation. Fairfax sent two troops of horse to disperse theiQ, who destroyed some of their implements and tools, and conducted a few of the more obstinate and petulant of them to prison `[Whitlocke, Apr. 17, 20 Winstanley, Cause of the Diggers.]`.

These diggers (not a very large but a very curious sect, and very expressive of the hope and the despondency of this strange and memorable time) were something in the nature of the Spencean philosophers, who themselves notorious some twenty years since. The names of two of their leaders have come down to us, Gerrard Winstanley and Everard. Winstanley wrote numerous tracts in support of their tenets; and from these we learn that their principles were, that God gave all things in common, and that every man has a right to the fruits of the earth. They professed an intention not to disturb any one in his possessions; but they asserted that the time was come when the whole world would shortly espouse their principles. They made their appearance at St. George's Hill, near Walton, in Surrey, Winstanley and Everard being at their head, with about thirty followers; and, resorting to an open common, they began to dig the earth, and deposit in it seeds and roots. They were not, hov. permitted to proceed in this very innocent and primitive occupation; for, alas! Fairfax sent two troops of horse to dispeise them, who destroyed some of their implements and tools, and conducted a few of the more obstinate and petulant of themselves to prison. See *Whitelocke, Pamphlets by Winstanley. Cause of the Diggers, &c. Godwin*, vol. ii. p 82.

Four months later, the exhortation 'To your tents, O Israel,' with which the earlier pamphlet had closed, bore fruit. On April 16, the Council of State received the following intelligence. 'On Sunday sennight last, there was one Everard, once of the army but cashiered, who termeth himself a prophet, and four more came to St George's Hill in Surrey and began to dig, and sowed the ground with parsnips, carrots and beans. On Monday following they were there again, being increased in their number. On Friday they came again, twenty or thirty, and wrought all day at digging. They do threaten to pull down and level all park pales and lay open and intend to plant them. They give out that they will be four or five thousand within ten days, and threaten the neighbouring people they will make them all come up to the hills and work.' The letter was at once forwarded by Bradshaw to Fairfax, with a request that he should send some horse to disperse the disorderly and tumultuous people. A force was at once dispatched, and three days later Fairfax was informed that the affair was not worth notice. There had never been above twenty of the diggers. They had met  Everard and Winstanley, their leaders, and they had promised to appear before Fairfax; but he would be glad to be rid of them again. `[Clarke Papers, n. 209—12.]` The following day the leaders appeared before the Council of State and explained their conduct. `[Declaration and Standard of the Levellers of England, T. P., vol. 551. The speech appeared in print on April 23. The account in Whitelocke, iii. 17-18, is transcribed almost verbatim from the pamphlet.]` All the liberties of the people, declared Everard, had been lost by the coming of the Conqueror. The time of deliverance was now at hand, and God would restore them their freedom to enjoy the fruits of the earth. A vision had appeared to him, and a voice had bade him dig and plough the earth and receive the fruits thereof. Their intention was to distribute the benefits of the earth to the poor and needy, to feed the hungry and clothe the naked. They did not intend to meddle with property nor to break any enclosures, but only to take what was common and untilled and to make it fruitful. They were willing to live in tents as their forefathers, whose principles they took for a model, had lived. The speaker had kept his hat on in the presence of the General, remarking that he was their fellow-creature.

No further steps were taken by the Government at the time. They felt, perhaps, that rumour had exaggerated the importance of the diggers, whom after Everard's speech they were inclined to regard as harmless fanatics. A week after the examination, however, appeared a manifesto revealing the fact that behind the artless confession to which they had listened lay a philosophy which threatened every existing institution.

The 'True Levellers' Standard Advanced, or the State of Community opened and presented to the sons of men.' published on April 26, was a 'declaration to the powers of England and to the powers of the world why the common people had begun to dig on St George's Hill.' 'In the beginning,' runs the manifesto, striking a new note in the first sentence, 'the great creator Reason made the Earth a common treasury for beasts and man.' Not a word was said by which one man could claim rule over another. But man falling into blindness was brought into bondage and became a greater slave to his own kind than the beasts of the field to him. Hereupon the earth, made for a common treasury or relief to all, was bought and sold, and was hedged in by the rulers and kept in the hands of a few. For a certain time the creator, the spirit Reason, thus suffered himself to be rejected; whence arose wars to uphold dominion and riches, the curse under which creation groans. But when the earth again becomes a common treasury, as it must, for Reason and all the prophecies of Scripture point to it, all enmity will cease; for none will desire a larger share than another. `[T. P. vol. 552, 6—11.
]` Passing from an exposition of their philosophy to a vindication of their recent conduct, the authors declare that they have met with resistance because they maintain an universal liberty, which was not only their birthright, but which they had bought with their money and blood in the war. All landlords lived in breach of the commandment 'Thou shalt not steal.' They had induced the plain-hearted poor to work for them with small wages, and by their work had made great fortunes. By their very labour the poor raised up tyrants to rule over them. The authors then state that it had been revealed to them in dreams where they should begin to dig, and that though the earth might be barren they should receive a blessing from the spirit. 'You Pharaohs, you have rich clothing and full bellies, you have your honours and your ease; but know the day of judgment is begun and that it will reach you ere long. The poor people you oppress shall be the saviours of the land. If you will find mercy, let Israel go free; break to pieces the bands of property.'
`[11—22.]`

The Diggers still remained quietly employed at St George's Hill. As Fairfax came from Guildford to London at the end of May, he visited the locality and found twelve of them hard at work. To a short admonition from the General, they replied that they were digging crown lands, and that the king who possessed them by the Norman Conquest being dead,they returned to the common people. `[Speeches of Fairfax to the Diggers, May 31, in T. P. vol. 531. A 'Declaration of the Well-Affected in Bucks,' contains the only positive approval that I can find that the colony met with. The locality snggests something more than a coincidence. Messenger, June 15, 58, 59. A faller, though later, account appeared in the Moderate.]` The very day after the visit of the General appeared another manifesto of the party, directed to the Lords of Manors. `[The rapacity of landlords had been the theme of every economist for half a century. Rogers, vol. v. ch. 2. A remarkable document, denouncing the landlords and asking that 'our natural inheritance shall retarn to us again,' emanated from Hertfordshire in 1647. Urwick's Nonconformity in Herts. 832, 3.]` It was prompted by the fact that they were in all directions cutting down and selling trees on common lands and thereby impoverishing them. `[Declaration of the Poor Oppressed People to Lords of Manors, 4, in T. P. vol. 667.]` 'God has enlightened our hearts,' said the writers, 'to see that the earth was not made purposely for you to be the lords and we to be your slaves.' But they still declared that they had no intention of resorting to force. This appeal producing no effect, a letter was soon after dispatched to Fairfax. He had been mild and moderate to them in court and when he had come to see them, and the author was thereby emboldened to plead with him for justice. The laws that had been made in the days of monarchy had given freedom to the gentry and clergy, but had done nothing for the people. `[Letter to Fairfax and the Council of War, T. P. vol. 560.]`

In July the persecution which they had so remarkably escaped fell upon them. Winstanley and two of his comrades were brought before the Court at Kingston for trespass, and the jury consisted of 'such as stood strongly for the Norman power.' They were forbidden to speak and were heavily fined. Thereupon they sent an account of their arrest and sentence to the House of Commons and once more explained their position and defended their claims. They enclosed a list of some of the abominations which William the Conqueror introduced into England, among which were those of tithes and lawyers. `[Appeal to the House of Commons, 15-17, T. P. vol. 564. Watchword to the City of London and to the Army, T. P. vol. 573.]` At the end of November a more serious attack was made upon the little community. A party of soldiers appeared, pulled down the two houses in which they were living and carried the wood away in a cart. A long and eloquent letter from Winstanley followed. The arguments are for the first time wholly devoid of the familiar Digger philosophy. There is not a word about Natural Right. They claim nothing more than the fulfilment of a contract. Parliament had virtually said to them, Give us taxes, free quarter, excise, venture your lives with us to cast out the oppressor, and we will make you a free people. They had agreed, and the victory had been won. The spoil should be equally divided between those who went to war and those who stayed at home and paid them. They claimed freedom in the common land by virtue of their conquest over the king, for they had bought it by their blood and money. If the Government denied them their request, it would have to raise money for their support; whereas, if they were allowed to reclaim the waste land, England would be correspondingly enriched. Besides, it was a stain on a Christian nation that there should be so much waste land and that so many should starve for want. `[Clarke Papers, ii. 217—21.]`

The destruction of the houses seems to have put an end to the little settlement; at any rate we hear no more of it. `[Under April 4, 1650, iii. 170, Whitelocke writes that a letter was sent from the diggers and planters of commons with the usual requests. It must have emanated from one or two individuals, for it makes no reference to any colony. A petition of Cumberland tenants to Oliver in 1654 is full of digger phraseology; bat it would be fanciful to suggest any direct connection. C. S. P. 1654, 294.]` But the leader of the Diggers was far from losing heart or bating a jot of his principles. In a 'New Year's Gift for the Parliament and Army,' Winstanley attempted to demonstrate that branches of kingly power still remained. Tithes had been promised to the clergy by the Conqueror on the condition they would 'preach him up'. Our old lawbooks were still in use and should be burnt in Cheapside. If the government was to be new, let the laws be new also. For England was a prison; the subtilties of its laws the bolts and bars; the lawyers its jailors. `[New Year's Gift, Jan. 17th, in T. P. vol. 587, 7—10.]` The second part of the pamphlet `[The Curse and Blessing that is in Mankind.]` contains one of the most remarkable passages Winstanley ever wrote and prepares us for the work on which he was about to engage. "At this very day poor people are forced to work for 4d. a day, and corn is dear. And the tithing-priest stops their mouth and tells them that 'inward satisfaction of mind' was meant by the declaration 'The poor shall inherit the earth.' I tell you, the scripture is to be really and materially fulfilled... You jeer at the name Leveller. I tell you Jesus Christ is the head Leveller." `[p. 41—3.]`

Gerard Winstanley had gradually won the position he now occupied as the acknowledged leader of the English Communists. His name had appeared at the head of the list of the fifteen who signed the 'True Levellers' Standard Advanced' and of the forty-five who subscribed to the Declaration to the Lords of Manors. Since then, almost every work produced by the movement had appeared in his name alone. The snatches of rhyme that are scattered through his pamphlets render it obvious that the Diggers' Song discovered among Clarke's MSS. is from his pen, while the similarity of position assumed in the *Light of Buckinghamshire* to that of the later pamphlets forbids us to believe that he was not author, or at least joint author, of the earliest manifesto of the movement. In striking contrast to his importance and ability is the impenetrable obscurity in which his early history is involved. `[His early works, The Mystery of God and The Breaking of the Day of God, are parely theological disquisitions, remarkable for nothing but their attack on the Church. Their mysticism evoked charges of heresy, to which Winstanley replied in Truth lifting its head above scandal. They must have had but a small circulation, for they were all missed by Thomason. They may be found in B. M. 4377, A 1, 2, and 4372, AA 17.]` He prefaces his 'Watchword to the City of London' with a few lines of autobiography. 'I was once a freeman of thine, but beaten out of estate and trade by thy cheating sons in the thieving art of buying and selling. I was therefore forced to live a country life, where likewise with taxes and free quarter my weak back found the burden heavier than I could bear.' While his worldly prospects were at a low ebb, however, he received consolation from an unexpected source. 'Not a year since, `[He is writing in the autumn of 1649.]` my heart was filled with sweet thoughts and many things were revealed to me I never read in books nor heard from the mouth of flesh; and when I began to speak of them, some people could not hear my words. Then I took my spade and began to dig on St George's Hill.' The experiment, as we have seen, had not been encouraging, but, undismayed by its failure, Winstanley now set himself to elaborate the constructive part of his system. In Feb. 1652, it was ready, and the 'Law of Freedom' appeared, with a dedication to 'All the Nations of the Earth.' `[T. P. vol. 655.]`

The Dedicatory Epistle informs Cromwell that he and his officers had not conquered by their unaided efforts but by the help of the common people, whose right in consequence it was to share in the victory and whom a change of names without a change of things would never satisfy. The clergy were opponents of liberty; yet tithes still swallowed up the savings of the poor. Even where the laws were good they were tampered with by magistrates. Worst of all, the landlords still ruled the country as tyrants. It might be asked how the clergy and the landowners were to exist if tithes and service were withdrawn. And the answer leads us to the kernel of Winstanley's teaching. A different system must be introduced.

In the new society there must be no buying nor selling, for with bargaining came deception and from deceit sprang oppression. With the disappearance of buying and selling, there will be no more lawyers. But may not one be richer than another? For two reasons he may not. In the first place, riches give men power to oppress their fellow men and stir up wars. And, secondly, riches are impossible to obtain by honest means. A man can never become wealthy by his unaided efforts; and if he is assisted by others, a share in the result of their joint exertions belongs to them. In the first chapter, Winstanley proceeds to declare that freedom is to be found only in the unimpeded enjoyment of the land. Property there must be; but all must possess it. A similar transformation must be effected in relation to magistracy. All bearers of office must be elected, and none may hold a post for more than one year. `[pp. 39—67]` Passing to the economic ordering of the new state, Production is to be carried on both by individual and cooperative activity. Exchange, however, is purely communistic; each brings what he has produced into the common store and takes what he needs either for maintenance or for his work. A certain quantum is expected from each, and if it is not forthcoming, the worker is placed under supervision and if necessary is punished. Should any abuse arise in drawing from the common stock, a similar course is followed. Education, which is universal, includes technical instruction. Work is expected from all under forty, and may be continued after that age at will. `[pp. 68—78.]` Those who have reached the age of sixty superintend the well-being of the entire community. The town and county officials compose the county Parliament and Court. Members of the national Parliament must be over forty, unless specially distinguished, and are chosen by all over twenty. The chief duty of the clergy is to provide instruction, on the weekly day of rest, consisting of a relation of the chief events which have happened during the week, readings from the laws of the land, and lectures on subjects of general interest. The priest is to confine himself to what he has learnt from study and observation. For to know the secrets of Nature is to know the works of God, and to know the works of God is to know God Himself. Marriage is a civil rite, and may be terminated for sufficient reasons by a declaration of the parties before an officer and witnesses. Buying and selling are punished with death; and to declare that the land is the property of any special individual subjects the speaker to branding. `[76—89.]`

Of Winstaniey there is little more to relate. `[The letter of Winstaniey to Fairfax and the Council of War, dated Deo. 8, 1649, Clarke Papers, II. 217-21, is wrongly inserted in the Calendar of State Papers for 1652, 3; and this mistake has led Bernstein (Geschichte i. 592-3) to record a final appearance of the diggers in 1653.]` Soon after completing the presentation of his thought, he seems to have joined the Quakers. His latest work, the *Saints' Paradise*, appearing in 1658, `[T. P. vol. 2137.]` combines something of his old spaciousness of thought with a quietism that is largely new. We notice with interest the blending of Quakerism and the Digger philosophy. 'The heart that thinks it cannot live without money, lands, the help of man and creatures, is tempted of the devil; the pure spirit or holy law within tells the heart he must be stript of all these and trust to Providence for subsistence.' `[pp. 32, 3.]`

It would be easy to exaggerate the importance of the little colony of Diggers on St George's Hill. The greater number of them, beyond all doubt, had no other views than were common to the Franconian and Thuringian peasants of 1525, or those who followed the standard of Ket in 1549. On the other hand, it would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of their spokesman in the history of thought. Alone of his English contemporaries, he recognised the wellbeing of the proletariat as constituting the criterion not only of political but of social and economic conditions. Determining that their rights were not secured in the actual state of society, he proceeded to develope a complete scheme of socialism. That he looked in a different direction from the other thinkers of the age constitutes his unique interest. In the earnest spirit which breathes through his scheme, Winstanley is perhaps equalled by Vairasse and Meslier and Cabet; in his consideration for the poor, he may be matched by the author of the *Utopia*. But in the completeness with which he anticipates modem developments, he stands alone. By his very weaknesses, too, he is curiously modern. Human nature is capable of transformation if certain changes are effected. The knowledge of the scholar is despised, for culture breeds contempt. 'Practical instruction' is to be followed by the study of natural science, and 'fantastic speculations' to be forbidden. Equally unsatisfactory is, of course, the reading of history. But when all the reservations that it is necessary to make are made, Winstanley can claim to have seen that certain ideas which were nominally accepted by the conscience of mankind involved far-reaching social and economic transformations, and to have proclaimed that until society was organised on a moral basis no political changes could bear fruit.

A watch-word to the city of London, and the armie: wherein you may see that Englands freedome, which should be the result of all our victories, is sinking deeper under the Norman power, as appears by this relation of the unrighteous proceedings of Kingstone-Court against some of the Diggers at George-Hill, under colour of law; but yet thereby the cause of the Diggers is more brightened and strengthened: so that every one singly may truly say what his freedom is, and where it lies / By Jerrard Winstanly.

...

But that all men may see, we are neither ashamed nor afraid,
to justi?e that cause we are arrested for, neither to refuse to
answer to it in a righteous way, therefore we have here delivered this up in writing, and we leave it in your hands, disavowing the proceedings of your Court, because you uphold
Prerogative oppression, though the Kingly office be taken away,
and the Parliament hath declared England a Common-Wealth,0
so that Prerogative Laws cannot be in force, unlesse you be
besotted by your covetousnesse and envy.
We deny that we have trespassed against those three men,
or Mr. Drake either, or that we should trespasse against any, if
we should dig up, or plow for a livelihood, upon any the wast   
Land in England; For thereby we break no particular Law made
by any Act of Parliament, but only an ancient custome, bred in
the strength of Kingly Prerogative, which is that old Law or custome, by which Lords ofMannours lay claime to the Commons,
which is of no force now to bind the people ofEngland, since the
Kingly power and office was cast out: and the common people,
who have cast out the oppressor, by their purse and pelson,
have not authorized any as yet, to give away from them their
purchased freedome; and if any assume a power to give away,
or withhold this purchased freedome, they are Traytors to this
Connnon—Wealth of England: and if they imprison, oppresse, or
put to death any for standing to maintaine the purchased freed-
ome, they are murderers and thieves, and no just rulers.
Therefore in the light of reason and equity, and in the light
of the National] Covenant, which Parliament and people have
taken, with joynt consent: all such Prerogative customes, which
by experience we have found to burden the Nation, ought to be
cast out, with the Kingly office, and the Land of England now
ought to be a free Land, and a common treasury to all her children, otherwise it cannot properly be called a Common—Wealth.
Therefore we justi?e our act of digging upon that hill, to
make the earth a common treasurie. First, because the earth
was made by Almighty God, to be a common treasury of livelihood for whole mankind in all his branches, without respect of
persons; and that not any one according to the Word of God
(which is love) the pure Law of righteousnesse, ought to be
Lord or landlord over another, but whole mankind was made
equal], and knit into one body by one spirit of love, which is
Christ in you the hope of glory, even all the members of mans
body, called the little world, are united into equality of love, to
preserve the whole body.

COBHAM: MANORIAL HISTORY

T. E. C. WALKER, F.S.A

pp70-1

A century later an attack on the commons was made by Gerrard Winstanley and his followers. Winstanley was probably born at Wigan in 1609, and having become some kind of clothman in London was bankrupted by the outbreak of the Civil War. About 1643 he accepted the hospitality of friends in Church Cobham, where he earned a precarious living pasturing his neighbours' cattle while his active brain conceived the political and religious ideas expressed in the Digger movement of 1649. This formed the first example of modern Utopian socialism designed as a party programme, and represents the beginning of modern socialism. `[Petegorskv, D. W., Left-wing Democracy in the English Civil War (London, 1940), p. 13.]` St George's Hill where the experiment started is in Walton-upon-Thames, and until some time between 1548 and 1609 was known as Oldebury from the earthwork which crowns its summit. Since another site of the Diggers was at St Margaret's Hill some George and Margaret ceremony as at Norwich may have originated the name. Winstanley's 70 or so disciples began to dig up part of St George's Hill for crops in April 1649, but it is not clear if the name of the site or the day of St George had any significance for them. The most detailed and vivid account of the Diggers at Cobham is in Sabine's *Works of Gerrard Winstanley*, full of local family names familiar in other contexts. From this book we see that if unrestrained eloquence alone could have brought success, Winstanley's experiment would indeed not have failed. In the autumn of 1649, the crops on St George's Hill having been destroyed, the Diggers started operations on Little Heath at Cobham, then larger than it is now. By April 1650 their 11 acres of corn and half a dozen temporary houses were destroyed by the lord of the manor, John Platt of West Horsley, in company with Thomas Sutton, the impropriator of the living, and Sir "Anthony" (probably Francis) Vincent whom the Diggers had offended by cutting wood on Stoke Common. It is only fair to say that one of Winstanley's worst tormentors, Ned Sutton, was possibly Edward Sutton who in 1621 was described as "a lunatique." The later life of Winstanley is obscure, but one of his name, prosperous and respectable, was living in Cobham until after 1670. As to his followers, it is not quite clear if all of them had no grazing or fuel rights at all on the common waste, but the fact that they dug up part of this common waste indicates a too small or non-existent share in the common arable fields.

THE "DIGGERS" OF ST. GEORGE'S HILL.

AN INTERESTING CHAPTER OF LOCAL HISTORY.

Most people who have taken an interest in the history of Surrey know that in the early days of the Commonwealth, some people known as the "Diggers" made a curious attempt to found a communisitic colony on St. George's Hill.

On Tuesday evening, at the York Road Social and Literary Guild, Woking, under the presidency Mr. W. R, Skeet. J.P., Mr. E. Chapman delivered an interesting lecture on this episode. It owed its origin, he said, to the teaching of one Gerrard Winstanley, whose views on many theological points coincided with those hold very shortly afterwards by the Society of Friends, but who, in his political teaching, anticipated much that in our times is associated with the Land Nationalisation doctrine of Mr. Henry George, and with the philosophy of greater a man, Leo Tolstoy. It is from Winstanley’s numerous pamphlets that we derive most of our knowledge of the events St. George’s Hill in 1649, the year whose commencement was marked by the execution of Charles I.

Winstanley was born at Wigan in 1609. Came to London as a young man, but was unsuccessful in business, and then lived, helped by his friends, first in Buckinghamshire, and later at Cobham, Surrey. In pamphlet after pamphlet he had been arguing that, with the fall of the monarchy, all privileges derived from the Crown, such as the lordships of manors, had fallen also, and that now the time had come for the common people to enter into their common wealth. The earth, he urged, should be common treasury for all, both rich and poor, that every one born in the land may be fed by the earth. His mother that brought him forth." Towards this end he suggested that the poor should enter upon the commons, dig and plant them, and share the fruit of their labour.

On April 1st, 1649. he, with a small hand of disciples from Cobham, started to dig what was then common land on St. George Hill, near the ancient earthwork. The people of Walton were alarmed, and Henry Sanders, of that town, lodged an information with the Council of State. The Council asked Lord Fairfax to send a troop of horse make inquiry, and the report of the captain of this troop is preserved. The soldier thought the matter hardly worth notice, but arranged that Winstanley and Everard, another leader of the diggers, should attend before Fairfax and explain their aims. Fairfax heard them, and seems to have dealt courteously with them, for in all their subsequent manifestoes they appeal to him as a friend. Indeed, a little later on, in June, 1649, Fairfax, on a journey from Guildford to London, turned aside to view and talk with the Diggers, again leaving a kindly impression.

The Walton people, however, were not so tolerant, end there is extant a long catalogue of the injuries inflicted by them on the Diggers. They tore down the little houses of the community, broke their carts, cut their spades to pieces, and, indeed, "the enemy were so mad, that they tumbled the earth up and down, and would suffer no corn to grow." Further, the county magistrates brought an action for damages in Kingston Court, and, after several adjournments and a constant refusal of the Diggers to fee an attorney, judgment was given for damages £1O and costs per man. The Court bailiffs attempted to execute the judgment, and started to carry off some cows which Winstanley was herding for a farmer. The cows were rescued, and Winstanley invited the bailiffs to execute their judgment on his body, not on his employer's cows. They explained that it was his goods and not his body on which they could levy distress. Some of the Diggers, however, were arrested, but were released shortly afterwards without trial.

By the end of the year some members had brought reproach the rest by scandalous behaviour, and the Diggers seem have beenat the end of their resources. St. George’s Hill was abandoned; a few, Winstanley among them, moved down Little Heath, Cobham, whence, in March, 1650, emissaries went into the Midlands to induce sympathisers to send contributions. This is the last trace of their doings, but of Winstanley it is further known that in 1652 he issued a book, entitled "The Law of Freedom in a Platform," in which he propounds a great scheme for the re-organisation of society on communistic lines. It was neither the first nor the last of such schemes in our literature, but it was the first worked out in detail by one of the common people. Of Winstanley’s subsequent life nothing is known, but from what is still available, in this later age, when so many of his ideas have become the commonplaces of political discussion, we may admit the modest claim he makes, that "in all the passages of these troubles, I have been willing to lay out what my talent was, to procure England's peace, inward and outward."

"DIGGERS" AT WELLINGBORO.

It is not generally known that about 376 years ago Wellingborough was the scene of the last operations of an organisation known as the Digger Movement, which had originated in Surrey under the leadership of one Gerrard Winstanley, a few years previously.

Winstanley was stated have been spiritually the father of the Quakers who arose soon after and adopted most of his principles and even the very phrases in which he expressed them. From Lancashire, where he was born, Winstanley went to London, where he started in trade but soon lost all he had and went to Buckinghamshire, where he lived on the charity of friends. The first time he came into notice was when a number persons began digging on St. George’s Hill in Surrey with the intention of sowing the ground with corn and other seeds. This was in the year 1645, in early April, on Sunday, and on the following day the number of diggers increased. This increase went on till the Friday of that week there were between 20 and 30 of the men at work.

MANY HARDSHIPS

The hardships from which so many were suffering made them nearly all hearty acceptors of the contentions of the Diggers that every one should work, and if all did so there would be plenty.

The little band of Diggers was applauded and helped. Some farmers sent them seed, others promised more when the land was ready. Wellingborough overseers were indifferent: the local magistrates refrained from interfering. It looked as if the wanderers had reached the promised land at last. They commenced in earnest the tilling of a portion of "Bareshanks," described as "part of the common land." "Bareshanks," as it was then, is now known as "Baregrass," at the end of the road leading from Wellingborough to Hardwick. From it run also roads to Mears Ashby and Sywell.

As soon as the Diggers got to work there they issued a manifesto, not in their own name, but in the names of the out-of-work people at Wellingborough.

LEADERS ARRESTED

The manifesto, which was printed and sold to any who would buy it, was a recitation of the principles of the Diggers. Winstanley followed it up with a broadsheet, backing up the Wellingborough declaration, which drew the attention of the Council of State, who wrote to Mr. Pentlow, a local magistrate. directing him to take action against the Diggers, four whom were arrested and the remainder dispersed by force — probably soldiers, as in the overseers' accounts for the year there were items concerning the call in soldiers.

The disheartened Diggers returned asbest they could to their homes, and were not heard of again . Winstaniey, it is recorded, at his death left a great legacy to George Fox and the Quakers.
