TO DO

The Forest of Dean, of about 19,000 acres in extent, is another of the few remaining Royal Forests, which have come under the consideration of Parliament in recent years, and where the policy of maintenance has prevailed over that of inclosure.

This Forest lies in the Hundred of St. Briavel, between the estuary of the Severn, and the river Wye, about twelve miles from Gloucester. Its condition as regards the Crown, the Commoners, and the public, is very similar to that of the New Forest. The Crown is the owner of the soil and of all the timber growing upon it. It has also large powers of temporarily inclosing parts of the Forest for encouragement of the planting and growth of timber. Subject to such powers, the Commoners, who are the owners and occupiers of land in the Hundred, extending over many parishes beyond the Forest, have the right of turning out their cattle to graze in it, and their pigs to feed on the acorns. Of the Forest, about 4,000 acres consist of heath and open land; the residue is planted with oak trees of ages, varying up to ninety years, of which a large proportion will be in their prime about thirty years hence, and the remainder at later dates.

Unlike the New Forest, that of Dean is a very rich mineral district, where coal and iron mines are worked. A large population is engaged in these mines, residing on inclosures of land, which have in past times been taken from the Forest, dispersed about in very irregular order. There is a very ancient and well-recognised custom that the inhabitants of the Hundred have the right to search for and to work the minerals within the Forest, subject to certain customary royalties to the Crown — a right not dissimilar to what exists in many parts of Europe, notably Spain, but not elsewhere known in England.

The iron mines were worked in very early times, as far back as the Romans, and this was doubtless facilitated by the Forest providing fuel for smelting the ore. There existed till within recent years vast heaps of partially smelted ore, called cinders, which had been left by early workers, who had not sufficient knowledge to extract the ore, and which it was worth while to smelt again. These testified to the extent of the industry in former times, and to the fact that there must have been a large population residing within the precincts of the Forest. `[Andrew Yarranton, in his work on the "Improvement of England by Sea and Land," printed in 1677, says: "In the Forest of Dean and thereabouts the iron is made at this day of cinders, being the rough and offal thrown by in the Romans' time; they then having only foot blasts to melt the ironstone; but now, by the force of a great wheel that drives a pair of bellows twenty feet long, all that iron is extracted out of the cinders, which could not be forced from it by the Roman foot blast. And in the Forest of Dean and thereabouts and as high as Worcester, there are great and infinite quantities of these cinders, some in vast mounts above ground, some under ground, which will supply the iron works for hundreds of years, and these cinders are those which make the prime and best iron and will make less charcoal than doth the ironstone." — Nicholls, Forest of Dean, p.223.]` The town of Cinderford, in the Forest, derives its name from these heaps.

As in the case of most of the Royal Forests, there is no record of the origin of that of Dean. It is first mentioned in Domesday Book as having been exempted from taxes by Edward the Confessor. William the Conqueror is known to have visited it occasionally for the purpose of hunting the deer. He was there in 1069, when he received tidings that the Danes had invaded Yorkshire, and had taken its capital. He is reported to have sworn a terrible oath by "the splendour of the Almighty," that "not one Northumbrian should escape his revenge," and he well kept his oath. `[Ib. p. 7]`

The Forest, like others, was greatly enlarged by the Norman kings succeeding the Conqueror, in the sense that they applied the forest laws to a great area of land in private ownership, extending up to Gloucester and to the Severn and Wye. These boundaries were again reduced by Henry III. and Edward I., in consequence of the grave complaints of the people as to the extension of the Royal Forests. Thus diminished, it was confined to the Hundred of St. Briavel, a district about twice the size of the present waste.

King Stephen granted the Forest to the daughter of Fitz-Walter on her marriage witli Herbert FitzHerbert; from her it passed through the families of the Bohuns and Newmarches, till it reverted to King John. This monarch was often in the district for sport. From his time to the present, the ownership of the soil appears to have been vested in the Crown; and there was a long succession of Wardens of the Forest, and Constables of St. Briavel's Castle, appointed for life by the Crown, till the duties of the Warden were vested, in 1834, in the Commissioners of Woods and Forests. The earliest perambulation of the Forest was in 1282; in 1333, Parliament confirmed the perambulation, and reduced it to the limits which existed up to 1834, when it was disafforested.

There are many interesting incidents connected with the Forest during this long period. It appears to have supplied timber for the construction of ships of war from an early time, and the oak grown there had the reputation of being exceptionally tough and well suited for war ships. So well was this reputation known that the destruction of the Forest was specially enjoined by the Spanish Government on the leaders of the Spanish Armada. Evelyn in his "Sylva" says on this point:— "I have heard that in the great expedition of 1588 it was expressly enjoined the Spanish Armada that if, when landed, they should not be able to subdue our nation and make good their conquest, they should yet be sure not to leave a tree standing in the Forest of Dean." Mr. Nicholls, the historian of the Forest, says on this, that Evelyn may have heard this story from Mr. Secretary Pepys, who might have been informed by his friend, Sir John Winter, the grandson of Sir William Winter, vice-Admiral of Elizabeth's fleet, and kinsman to Thomas Winter of Huddington, who was constantly aiding the Spanish Eomanists in their intrigues.

In 1638, we first come across indications that there was fear of failure of the supply of timber from this Forest. A report was received by the Crown that the trees numbered 105,000, containing 62,000 tons of timber, of which only 14,000 loads were fit for shipbuilding, as the trees were generally decayed and past their full growth. By the authority of Sir Bayham Throgmorton 16,000 acres were ordered to be taken in. The Commoners after some discussion assented, in consideration of 4,000 acres being set apart for their own use, in different parts of the Forest. Before, however, anything could be done in this direction, Charles I., in his necessities, sold all the mineral rights in the Forest, and all the timber trees and underwood in it, to Sir John Winter, for £10,000 down, the yearly sum of £16,000 for six years, and a fee farm rent of £1,950 for ever.

This act was equivalent to a sale of the Forest, though the ownership of the soil was still retained in the Crown. The commoners and inhabitants of the Forest were greatly dissatisfied; they took advantage of the disorders of the Civil War to throw down the fences, which the grantee had already begun to make. Sir John Winter was a prominent and devoted Royalist during this period. He endeavoured to rouse the population of the district in favour of the king; but his inclosures under the Royal grant had made him unpopular, and the people sided in the main with the Parliament. The supply of iron from the Forest for the founding of cannon was an important consideration. Finally Winter, after many conflicts, was forced to fly, and his stronghold, Lydney House, was captured. His property was assigned to his victor, General Massy, together with his iron mills and woods, but with the reservation of timber trees which were not to be felled.

During the Commonwealth, frequent orders were made by Parliament with the object of preventing the destruction of timber in the Forest by unauthorised persons, and directing that any trees which had been cut down should be reserved for the use of the Navy.

In 1650, orders were given for the suppression and destruction of the iron works, — partly with the view of saving the timber of the Forest, which was heavily drawn upon for fuel for the smelting. In 1656, an Act was passed for mitigating the rigour of the forest laws, and for preserving the timber in the Forest. An effort was consequently made to carry out the arrangement of a few years previous, under which 16,000 acres were to be inclosed and planted. This was again resisted by the population of the district. They broke in and destroyed the fences. On May 11th, 1059, Colonel White reported to the House of Commons that upon the 3rd of that month—

"divers rude people in a tumultuous way in the Forest of Dean did break down the fences, and cut and carry away the gates of certain coppices, inclosed for the preservation of timber, turned in their cattle, and set divers places of the Forest on fire to the great destruction of growing wood."

It appears that the popular feeling of the district had been aroused by the fact, that in pursuance of the policy of re-afforesting the 16,000 acres, 400 cottages of poor people living on the waste had been thrown down. This action of the Commonwealth created a reaction in the district in favour of the Royalist party, and it was reported that large numbers of people were ready to support the cause of the Stuarts.

On the restoration of Charles II., all the proceedings of the Commonwealth were nullified, and the grant in favour of Sir John Winter was revived. He proceeded to put his rights under it in force, by making inclosures. He was again strongly opposed by the inhabitants of the district. They petitioned the king for inquiry.

In December, 1661, a Commission was issued to inquire into the state of the Forest, and to advise in accordance with the prayers of the petitioners:—

:whether the Forest may be restored to his Majesty's demesne, and re-afforested and improved by inclosure for a future supply of wood for a constant support of the iron works there, producing the best iron of Europe for many years, and other uses in time to come which might be of great use for defence of the nation, the old trees then standing being above 300 years growth, and yet as good timbers as any in the world, and the ground so apt to produce and so strong to preserve timber, especially oaks, that within 100 years there may be sufficient provision there found to maintain the Navy royal for ever."

The result of this inquiry was that the grant to Winter was surrendered, and a new lease was given to him for a term of years, after negotiations with Pepys, which are duly mentioned in his Diary.

Acting under this new lease, Winter again began to inclose the Forest, and again the popular feeling of the district was aroused against him. Complaints were made to the House of Commons, and a Committee was appointed to consider the matter. It appears that the freeholders, commoners, and inhabitants of the district met together and made proposals to the Committee for the settlement of the Forest, in which they offered very large concessions in the direction of inclosure for the improvement of the growth of timber. The Forest then consisted of 24,000 acres. They proposed that 11,000 acres should be inclosed by the Crown, and be discharged of rights of pasture, estover and pannage; and that the Crown, on throwing open any of these inclosures, might take in as much, so that not more than 11,000 acres should be inclosed at any one time; that the timber on the remaining 13,000 acres should belong absolutely to His Majesty, discharged of estovers for ever, and of pannage for twenty-one years; that the whole waste of the Forest should be re-afforested, and be subjected to forestal law; but that this should not in future apply to the lands in private ownership, not waste of the Forest; that no more than 800 deer should be maintained by the Crown; and that all grants of the waste lands should be resumed and made void.

These proposals were agreed to by the Committee of the House of Commons, and were recommended to the Government. A Bill was introduced to carry them into effect, but Parliament was prorogued before it became law, and it was not until 1668, that an Act was passed substantially embodying these terms.

In the meantime Sir John Winter, under the powers of his lease, played havoc with the timber in the Forest. The Committee, in 1663, had already reported to the House "that Winter had 500 cutters of wood employed on the Forest, and that all the timber would be destroyed if care should not be speedily taken to prevent it." In vain the House of Commons made recommendations for the preservation of the timber. Winter still kept on his cutting; and in 1667, it was reported to the Government that of 30,233 trees sold to Winter, only about 200 remained standing, and that from 7,000 to 8,000 loads of timber suitable for the Navy were found wanting.

The Act of 1668 embodied the proposals of the people of the Forest, as approved by the Committee, with little variation. It maintained all the rights of miners of the district. Strangely enough, after all the complaints of Winter's conduct, the Act saved his rights under his lease. Whether it was that he had already exhausted all his power of cutting timber, or that he had influential friends at Court, in consequence of his efforts for the monarchy during the rebellion, it is clear that he was treated with great consideration.

The Act of 1668 has ever since been the charter of the Forest, and to the present time determines the relative rights of the Crown and the commoners. Immediately after it was passed, 8,400 acres of the waste were inclosed and planted, ahd the residue of the 11,000 were dealt with in the same manner a few years later. From that time till a comparatively recent date, there were constant complaints of encroachments on the Forest, and of illegal cutting of trees, mainly for the purpose of supplying timber to the miners.

Meanwhile the mining industry was continually increasing. Till relatively recent times, the iron mines were by far the most important, and for these the supply of wood from the Forest, for smelting, was most necessary. There is mention of coal so far back as the year 1300, but it was for long a subordinate industry. In 1610, a grant was made by James I. to the Earl of Pembroke of "liberty to dig for and take within any part of the Forest, or the precincts thereof, such and so much sea-coal as should be necessary for carrying on the iron works." This is the earliest notice of coal being used in the iron works. Coal was included in the grant by Charles I. to Winter, who, we learn from Pepys, was interested in a project for charring it so as to render it fit for the iron furnace — but apparently without success. Cromwell also had been engaged in association with Major Wildman, Captain Birch, and other of his officers in an enterprise of the same kind; and large works were set up in the Forest for this purpose, but without any success. From the beginning of the eighteenth century the working of the coal mines rapidly increased, and they eventually became far more important and valuable than the iron mines. The timber of the Forest was essential to the working of these mines; and the coal was ultimately substituted for wood in the manufacture of iron.

The Crown had from an early date recognised the rights of the Free Miners, as they were called, to search for and work both iron and coal mines. It is very doubtful whether this custom would have been acknowledged as a legal right, if it had been questioned in the Law Courts, owing to the technical rule laid down in "Gateward's case" as to customs and prescriptions of the inhabitants of a district. In a case which turned indirectly upon the rights of miners, `[Attorney-General v. Mathias. 4 K. & J., 579.]` Mr. Justice Byles laid down, that but for the Act of 1838, in which the rights of the Free Miners were confirmed, they could not have been sustained, on the ground that a custom could not be maintained to take profits out of another man's land.

"It seems to me" he said, "first, that the Free Miners themselves could, in point of law, have had no such right as the defendants' claim assumes them to have had. The claim of the Free Miners is to subvert the soil, and carry away the substratum of stone without stint or limit of any kind. This alleged right, if it ever existed, must have reposed on one of three foundations: custom, prescription, or lost grant. The right of the Free Miners is incapable of being established by custom, however ancient, uniform, and clear the exercise of custom may be. The alleged custom is to enter the soil of another, and carry away portions of it. The benefit to be enjoyed is not a mere easement; it is a *profit à prendre*. Now, it is an elementary rule of law that a *profit à prendre* in another's soil cannot be claimed by custom, for this, among other reasons, that a man's soil might thus be subject to the most grievous burdens in favour of successive multitudes of people, like the inhabitants of a parish or other district, who could not release the right. The leading case on the subject is *Gateward's case*, which has been repeatedly followed and never overruled. ...

"The next question is: Can such a right as this be claimed by prescription? I will assume, against the fact, that there is no evidence to negative prescription. The present is a claim not only to carry away the soil of another, but to carry it away without stint or limit; it is a claim which tends to the destruction of the inheritance, and which excludes the owner. A prescription to be good must be both I'easonable and certain (Comyn's Digest, "Prescription"); and this alleged prescription seems to me to be neither. . . .

"The only remaining question on this part of the case is this: Can the claim be sustained by evidence of a lost grant? Prescription presupposes a grant; and if you cannot presume a grant of an unreasonable claim before legal memory, *à fortiori* can you not presume one since. The defendants have relied on statutes of limitation; but, as to that, a claim which is vicious and bad in itself cannot be substantiated by a user, however long."

Fortunately for the Free Miners, their rights were not in issue in this case. They had already been determined and legalised by the Act of 1838, which distinctly laid down that all the male persons born and abiding in the Hundred of St. Briavel, and of the age of twenty-one years and upwards, who should have worked a year and a day in coal or iron mines within the Hundred, should be entitled to be registered as Free Miners; and that only Free Miners should have the exclusive right of having gales or works granted to them by the officer, called the gaveller, to open mines within the Hundred. Such gales or grants confer an interest in the nature of real estate, and are perpetual, subject to conditions for the payment of certain rents and royalties to the Crown. These royalties are fixed on the assumption that, after the coal or iron has been reached, the Crown is entitled to one-fifth of the net profit of working the mine. In case of dispute the royalty is settled by arbitration, and then remains fixed for twenty-one years. The Free Miner can sell his gale, and a large part of the mines in the district are not now held by Free Miners, but by persons who have purchased up the interests in their gales. Nearly the whole of the coal field in the Forest is now included in existing gales.

Under this system the mining industry has grown up. The output of the coal mines now averages about 900,000 tons a year, and that of the iron mines about 100,000 tons. The royalties to the Crown produce annually about £12,000 for coal and £5,000 for iron. The existing gales of coal and iron are 260, of which not more than 80 are worked.

It would seem that the growth of population caused by this great increase of mines, has long ago necessitated the appropriation of parts of the Forest for their accommodation. Of the 24,000 acres, of which the Forest consisted in the time of Charles II., only 18,500 acres are now forest or waste, 700 acres belong to the Crown, and 4,800 acres are the property of private individuals, as a result of encroachments from time to time on the waste, eventually recognised by the Crown. On this private land has grown up the town of Cinderford, and several other villages, in a very irregular manner, often without adequate drainage.

In 1874, in consequence of complaints of the want of sufficient accommodation for the population, and of the sanitary defects of the district, a select Committ€e was appointed by the House of Commons to inquire into the condition of the Forest. The inquiry escaped the notice of those interested in Commons, and the Committee, then appointed, contained no member who represented the views of the Commons Society.

The Committee reported that the rights of Free Miners tended to obstruct the advantageous development of the Forest mineral field, and were detrimental to the interests of the Crown, and of the public; that the rights were almost valueless to those not already holding gales; that the general feeling in the neighbourhood was in favour of the commutation of the legal rights of the Commoners; and that the convenience of the mining population, and of the mining works, required that the Crown should have power to sell portions of the Forest free from Common rights. They stated that the existing plantation was in a thriving condition, varying in age from ten to seventy years, and that in about fifty years a large proportion of them would reach maturity. The Committee did not consider that it would be expedient to destroy or alienate the existing oak plantations, or any large part of them; but that, as far as possible, the sales of land should be confined to the outskirts of the Forest, and to the vicinity of existing houses.

In the following year, 1875, a Bill was introduced by the late Mr. W. H. Smith, then Secretary to the Treasury, for the purpose of carrying these recommendations into effect. It was in fact an Inclosure Bill. It gave power to the Crown to ascertain and buy off the Commoners' rights, and to convert the Forest into its absolute property. As regards the Free Miners, it proposed that in future no fresh gales should be granted, and that the Crown should be empowered to buy up and extinguish existing gales.

It very soon appeared that the Committee of 1874 had been entirely misled as to the feeling of the people of the district, on the subject of their rights of common over the Forest, and us to the maintenance of the rights of Free Miners. Indignation meetings were held in the district to protest against the Bill. Numerous petitions were presented against it by the Free Miners and the Commoners, and the Commons Society was appealed to, to assist in defeating the measure. The Society, while not averse to giving power to the Crown to provide for the necessities of the district by selling sites for houses, gardens, and allotments, free from common rights, were of opinion that the conversion of the whole Forest into the absolute ownership of the Crown was unnecessary and unadvisable, and they lent their aid to defeat the scheme. The Bill was dropped for that year; but in the following autumn, notices were issued of the intention of the Government to introduce the Bill again in the ensuing Session. Thereupon, on behalf of the Commons Society, I entered into a correspondence with Mr. W. H. Smith, in which I pointed out the objections on principle to the inclosure of the Forest. I contended that there were precisely the same reasons against adopting this course, as had been asserted by the Committee of the House of Commons in 1875, of which Mr. W. H. Smith himself had been Chairman, against the inclosure of the New Forest; that the object and intention of that Committee was to preserve the New Forest open and uninclosed, for the benefit of the Commoners and the public enjoyment; that the Forest of Dean was not unworthy of the same treatment; and that, although there was less of ancient timber left in it, it had some natural advantages superior even to the New Forest.

I further informed him that we had reason to know that very strong opposition would be made by the Commoners and Free Miners of the Forest to the proposed Bill; but that I was authorised to say that these people would not object to the inclosure by the Crown, free from common rights, of portions of the open land of the Forest near to the towns and villages, to the extent of 1,000 or even 2,000 acres, sufficient to meet all the necessities of the district for increased accommodation of the population, for residences, gardens, and allotments. I also pointed out that there could be no reason why a different policy should be pursued in respect of the two Forests; that both of them in their present condition were valuable legacies to the nation; that, if reduced into absolute ownership of the Crown, they could not be recovered; while, so long as they were subject to Commoners' rights, they could from time to time be adapted to any necessary want, such as that now existing in the Forest of Dean for sites for miners' houses and for allotments, without depriving them of their value for public enjoyment and recreation.

The effect of this correspondence was that the Government announced that they did not intend to proceed farther with their measure for inclosing the Forest; and that they were advised by their Law Officers that they had, under an existing Act, power to sell limited parts of the waste, from time to time, for the necessities of the population. It resulted, therefore, that practically the same policy was laid down with respect both to the New Forest and the Forest of Dean. They are both to be preserved henceforth in the interest of the public and of the commoners, while the Crown is secured in its long established right of making large but temporary inclosures for the planting and growth of timber.
