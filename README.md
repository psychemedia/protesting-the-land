Tales relating to land protests


They hang the man and flog the woman  
That steal the goose from off the common  
But let the greater villain loose  
That steals the common from the goose.

The law demands that we atone  
When we take things we do not own,  
But leaves the Loards and Ladies fine  
Who takes things that are yours and mine.

Old English Nursery Rhyme, c. 1764
