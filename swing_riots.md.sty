ISLE WIGHT, Saturday, Nov. Newport.— Great alarm has been felt by the inhabitants of tbe island during the week, owing to the spirit of disorder which has manifested itself. On Monday the greatest consternation prevailed at Newport, in consequence of information that the paupers employed cultivating the lands of the House of Industry, in Parkhurst Forest, were in a state of revolt, and intended to march a body to the town, for the purpose of demanding an increase of pay. Henry, Sewell, Esq. of the firm of Sewell, Hearn, and Sewell, mounted his horse, with the praiseworth} intention of meeting the men, but unfortunately, in hastily turning the corner of the street, by the Free Grammar School, the horse fell, and was very much injured, and Sewell was severely bruised as to prevent his proceeding. Two other however, went to the Forest, and promising tohe men that the wages should be increased, succeeding res oringorder.' Whilst these proceedings were on, the Magistrates assembled at the Town Hall, and swore in about 100 respectable tradesmen as constables. A general meeting of the inahabitants of the island is convened for this day, to take into consideration the best means to effectually check the spirit of insubordination which extensively prevails; and large rewards are for the discoveryof ill disposed persons, it hoped that further mischief and outrage will be prevented. On Wednesday a meeting was held, and a liberal subscription c into,' for the purpose supplying the poor with coals during the winter. Married, oil Tuesday, Whippingham, the Rev. Mr. Sew 11, Lieut.

TO DO

ISLE WIGHT, Saturday, Dec. 4. Newport.—The island has been for some days past in a state of excitement, rather from the - prehension of riots amongst the labouring classes, than from any overt acts of violence. Threatening letters have been received by several farmers, inconsequence of which thrashing machines have been generally disused. Symptoms of discontent made their appearance during the last week amongst the paupers employed en the Forest Farm, and at one time an actual strike took place, and they left their work for the purpose of visiting some neighbouring farmers. They, however, took wit in their anger, and after a little confusion returned to their work. The statement that they were pacified a promised advance of wages is erroneous. No concession has taken place to any violent demands, but an addition to their wages was made last week by the guardians of the poor, in consequence of an advance in the price of bread. With the present arrangement they have expressed themselves satisfied. As farmers labourers are generally very well contented, the island is likely to remain in its present state of tranquillity. Proper precautions, have, however, been taken by the Magistrates to repress any disposition to disturbance. Special constables have been, sworn in different parts the island, and a public meeting has been held, which the great body of respectable inhabitants, public resolution, expressed their willingness and desire, to eo-pperate with the Magistrates in any measures for the preservation of good order. Fires have, however, taken place, which must be attributed to the incendiary system. A hay rick belonging to Mr Tucker, of this town, was set fire to on Saturday night last, and totally destroyed. The inhabitants of the town were called from their beds an alarm the fire bell. Engines was immediately prepared, and every exertion used to stop the progress of the flames, but without success. Two men are custody on strong suspicion. A hay stack, to very Rev. the Dean of Ely, at Freshwater, and thrashing machine, belonging to Mr. Rich. Harvey, at Rookley, were wilfully destroyed by fire on Sunday night, and an attempt was made, without success, the same night, to set fire to a corn stack Gatehouse Farm, near Ryde. Every exertion is making to discover the offenders, and from our insular situation, and the great difficulty of escape, not doubted that the guilty parties will soon brought to justice. Large rewards have been offered for their discovery, addition the sums offered by Government. Rewards have also been offered and measures taken for the apprehension of any persons who may attempt to excite disturbance, it being suspected tbat agents have been sent here for the purpose. Married, Tuesday, at Kingston, Mr. S. Saunders, butcher, to Miss Baker, daughter of Mr. Baker, of Corve Farm. Cowes.—A meeting was convened at the Town Hall on Monda}', at the instance of the Magistrates of the Island, to consider and adopt the most effectual measures, in case of need, of quelling any tumult that might arise in the town or neighbourhood. The general opinion however appeared to be that, from the locality of the no incitement existing in the minds of the labouring class, there was but little to apprehend ; but should any incendiaries make their appearance, or any outrages take place, the whole of the inhabitants would unite in body. A few special constables were, nevertheless, sworn, to be ready on the first alarm.

NEWPORT, Dec.4.] The Island has been for some days past in a state of excitement, rather from the apprehension of possible riots amongst else labouring classes, than from any overt acts of violence.

They however took Ir- wit intheirlauger, and afteraltl cifutsion, retnsmed to their oxt work. The statement containued inlisah Ka')Jsslssirvehonieiilu of ,lest week, that they ware pacified by a promised advance of wages, 'rs, isaerroneousa. No concession has taken place to Any violent dr- mands, but an attdition to their wages was made last week by the sat,~ Guartliasa of the Poor, in consequence of an advance so the price d.; 'of bread in the town of Newport. With the present a~rrangeniant tisey have expressed themselves satisfied; and as tlse labourers per employed by the farmers are generally very weell contentedl, we )rhave reason to believe that the Ilansd will rensaia in its present tranquihlity. Proper precautions have however been taken by the Magistrates to repress any' disposition to disturbance; special toconstables have bean sworn in -in different parts of the lsaltudt; cls, and a public meeting was held on Saturday ltiet, at which' the great body of respectable inhabitants by a public zaeslution ax- per pressed their willingness and desire to co-operate with the Magig- trates in such measures as they might thiolt it right to adopt Lot~ lisa preservation of good order. We regret,- however, to state'i that fires have taken place since the last week, whirls we see rem- ?? pelled to attribute to the incendiary system. A hay-rick, belong- ni ag to M~r.
