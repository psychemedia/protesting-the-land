The Goose and the Common

> The Askew Sisters sang Goose & Common on their 2019 CD Enclosure. They noted:
> 
> Hazel was inspired to put this song together by a talk in her local park which celebrated the 170th anniversary of the Chartists marching on Kennington Common to gain better voting rights for working people.... The earliest reference to it that we can find is from The Gentleman’s Mathematical Companion in 1816, where it’s noted as being seen on a handbill in Plaistow protesting a Bill for the enclosure of Epping Forest, but its origins may well be much older.

Goose & Common

The law condemns the man or woman  
Who steals the goose from off the common,  
But leave the greater villain loose  
Who steals the common from off the goose.

The law demands that we atone  
When we take things we do not own,  
But leaves the lords and ladies fine  
Who take things that are yours and mine.

(repeat first verse)

The poor and wretched don’t escape  
If they conspire the law to break.  
That must be so, but they endure  
Those who conspire to make the law.

(repeat first verse)

The law condemns the man or woman  
Who steals the goose from off the common,  
But geese will still a common lack  
Until they go and steal it back.

The Goose & the Common

They hang the man and flog the woman  
Who steals the goose from off the common  
But leave the greater villain loose  
Who steals the common from off the goose

The law demands that we atone  
When we take things we do not own  
But leaves the lords and ladies fine  
Who take things that are yours and mine

The poor and wretched don’t escape  
If they conspire the law to break  
This must be so but they endure  
Those who conspire to make the law

The law locks up the man or woman  
Who steals the goose from off the common  
And geese will still a common lack  
Until they go, and steal it back

Lyrics:
The law locks up the man or woman.  
Who steals the goose from off the common,  
But leaves the greater villain loose  
Who steals the common from the goose.

Chorus: 
Who remembers when, who remembers how.  
The crimes committed then became the laws that bind us now?

The law demands that we atone.  
When we take things we do not own,  
But leaves the lords and ladies fine.  
Who take things that are yours and mine.

The poor and wretched don't escape.  
If they conspire the law to break.  
This must be so, but they endure.  
Those who conspire to make the law.
 
The law locks up the man or woman.  
Who steals the goose from off the common,  
But geese will still a common lack.  
Until they go and steal it back.

(The following was a widely syndicated story)

CONNUBIAL TENDERNESS.— A short time ago, one William Wright was committed to the House of Correction, at Lewes, in Sussex, charged with stealing a goose, the property of Mr. C. Saxby, of Rodmel; the person was taken up on the information of his wife, who made two pies of the stolen goose, but owing to some disagreement on the subject, refused to bake them; where- upon the husband turned cook, but while he consciencious rib went to Mr. Saxby, and impeached him of the theft, with a view, as she says, of giving a timely check to his pilfering habits, by subjecting him to a small punishment, the smart of which might deter him from the commission of higher crimes, and ultimately save him from the gallows!

I doubt if the authorship of this epigram can be traced. By the by, there is another version of the lines, headed thus:—

STEALING THE GOOSE FROM THE COMMON.— I am inclined to think that the following epigram has already appeared in the exhaustive pages of 'N. & Q.' or, at any rate, a variant of it. It was, I believe, Charles James Fox who called Norfolk a "gigantic goose green." The epigram is thus given in "Sabrinae Corolla,' fourth series, p. 147, is called a Norfolk saw, and is translated into Latin verse by B. H. Kennedy, D.D., for many years Head Master of Shrewsbury School:—

*Common Sins.*

A sin it is for man or woman  
To steal the goose from off the common;  
But 'tis a crime without excuse  
To steal the common from the goose.

*Communia Damnna.*

Ansere qui rapto fraudavit publica rura.  
Peccati gravis est, vir, mulierque reus,  
Ansere fraudato rapuit qui publica rura,  
Delicto fuerit vel graviore nocens. K.

JOHN PICKFORD, M.A. Newbourne Rectory, Woodbridge.

The following epigram, though fairly well known, haa, I think, not been quoted in your pages:—

'Tis bad enough in man or woman  
To steal a goose from off a common;  
But surely he's without excuse. 
Who steals a common from a goose.

My version is taken from Carey's 'Commonplace Book of Epigrams' 1872. Is the local tradition true that this was directed against Charles Pratt, first Earl Camden, who, by an arrangement with the parishioners of Chislehurat, took from the common a strip of land in front of Camden House, which still remains incorporated in the grounds of that mansion? In the 'Report of the Charities Committee of the Parish Council of Chislehurst' I find the following:—

"Camden Estate. — Further land northward of Camden House waa enclosed in 1760 at the yearly rent of 2/., and another piece of land in front of Camden House was granted by an order of the Vestry, dated the 7th October, 1764, to Lord Chief Justice Pratt on his paying to the Churchwardens for the use of the poor the yearly rental of 1*l.* 1*s.*"

Mr. Windham was still of the same opinion as before: Were these things contrary te any moral principle? Pattiament was a place of trust, but so were the places in our Courts of Law which were avowedly sold. A man who exchanged influence for money was not necessarily corrupt. It did not follow that paying for seats was corrupt. Morality had nothing to do with the matter, At a Norfolk election, one of the candidates was obnoxious for having enclosed a common: a question was asked, "what does he deserve who steals the common from the goose?" the answer was, "to be hanged," And this was followed up by another question: "what does he deserve who steals the goose from the common?—(*A laugh.*)— But though it would have beeh wrong to have stolen the goose from the common, it was not so to have stolen the common from the goose. In the like manner, it might be very improper to bribe voters and yet perfectly innocent to buv or sell a seat. Men were often desirous of change for wilful motives; who, like the woodpecker, went round the tree searching for an unsound part to catch the grubs and worms; but they did not do this for food, like the woodpecker, but in order to destroy the tree. What could be the motives of those who told the people that Reform would free them from the Income tax?—(*Loud cries of hear! hear! from all sides*).— Could they believe this themselves? If they did not, what was to be thought of them? Much of the abuse of patronage came from the lowest orders to the top. Jobs began often at popular elections, witness the perjuries, &c. of the Middlesex election. When the friend  of a Minister refused an elector a favour, the elector took the independent side, and bawled for reformn.—(*A laugh!*)

"That, in the opinion of this House, this Bill does not give adequate protection to the interests of the rural labourers, and does not provide proper securities against the inclosure oi those Commons which it is desirable to preserve in their uninclosed condition for the use and enjoyment of the people."

pp. 1239-41

Commons Bill Committee, May 25, 1876

... A clause had been introduced into the Inclosures Act Amendment of 1852 which permitted 50 acres of any common to be sold with the consent of the lord and two-thirds of the commoners. If 50 acres, why not the whole common ? Some commons were

not 50 acres in extent. Why should not Parliament do its utmost to facilitate the acquisition by purchase of suburban open spaces, by urban authorities, under the superintendence of the Inclosure Commissioners? That was not, however, the view the hon. Member for Eeading took of the matter. He was for stepping over the timid counsels of the National Assembly, and boldly proclaiming, with the Convention of 1794, that the oldest and longest established rights of property in these islands, titles which were at least as old as the AngloSaxon race, were to g^ve way, without compensation, to claims which he himself allowed were opposed to all common and statute law — claims which he had himself, in great part, invented, were to supersede titles to the ownership of land which had existed for centuries before the tenure in fee-simple by which we now held land was ever thought of. Nothing short of that would satisfy the hon. Member for Eeading, and the party who was acting with him. The ownership of a common was nearly allied to corporation property; though the titles were far more ancient. It belonged in certain undivided shares to certain individuals. If their rights were invaded by Parliament in favour of what the hon. Member for Eeading called the public, he (Mr. Knight) would ask what corporate property would be safe for a twelve month after such a precedent, if the public wanted it ?

Ue would now read to the House a very curious letter received since the last debate from a neighbour of his, a capital sportsman. He said —

"Dear Mr. Knight, — Having seen in the newspapers that there is a Commons Inclosure Bill before the House of Commons, I wish to bring before your notice a case which happened on my father's common several years ago — viz., that a tourist then staying at Lynton was roaming about our common, and, after sitting down to his lunch, he sot fire to the most valuable part of the common for black game and thu wild red deer. We found out where he was staying at Lynton, and he gave his name as a Mr. Shaw Lef evre, a son of the Speaker of the House of Commons, or his nephew,"

the writer forgot which. His correspondent added that he had to ride about collecting men to beat out the fire, but they did not succeed in extinguishing it before the burning of about 130 acres. [Mr. Shaw Lefevrk : What year?] The letter did not say. Great part of this common was now devoted to the service of the public. It was devoted to the

maintenance of the wild red deer. Persons were kept off the common during eight months of the year, and during the other four months the publio were free to gallop oyer it. He (Mr. Knight) did not say that municipalities should be prevented from obtaining commons near sreat towns, but there should be facflities for indosingin other places. A Committee of the House of Commons could distinguish perfectly the places were commons should be inclosed and where they should not. He believed that this BiU, if it conferred more assistance upon towns to acquire this kimd of property, would be a very good Bill indeed.

Mb. SHAW LEFEVBE assured the House that he would not detain it at very great length; in the first place, because his hon. Friend the Member for Hackney (Mr. Fawcett) had covered the whole ground, and, in the second place, because he addressed the House at some length on the second reading of the Bill. He was quite prepared to bear most ample testimony to the good intentions of the Home Secretary. Nothing could be more satisfactory than the statements made by the right hon. Qentieman on various occasions. He had declared that the main object of the Bill was to put a stop to inclosures, and to regulate rather than inclose commons; and he had quoted the well-known lines, which, he believed, were taken from *Hudibras* though he (Mr. Shaw Lefevre) had never been able to find them —

"The law condemns both man and woman  
Who steals the goose from off the common,  
Bnt does not punish, what's far worse,  
Stealing the common from the goose."

Mr. ASSHETON CROSS: The last two lines should run —

"But lets the greater felon loose  
Who steals the common from the goose."
